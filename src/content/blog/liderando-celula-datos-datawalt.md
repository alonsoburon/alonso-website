description: 'My experience leading the creation of the first Data Engineering Cell at Datawalt and the challenges of scaling a corporate data platform'
---

When I joined Datawalt as a BI Development Engineer in May 2024, the company faced a critical challenge: it needed to scale and unify its data management at the corporate level. One year later, not only did we solve that problem, but I founded and now lead the company's first Data Engineering Cell.

## The Initial Challenge

Datawalt had multiple scattered data sources, legacy systems that didn't communicate with each other, and a growing need for unified reports and analytics. The goal was clear: create the best data extractor in LATAM.

## The Solution: Proprietary Software

Instead of relying on external tools, we decided to create our own homogeneous data management software. This decision allowed us to:

- **Total control** over the data architecture
- **Specific optimization** for our needs
- **Scalability** without depending on third-party limitations
- **Improved efficiency** by 40% in processing times

## Founding the Data Cell

The success of the initial project led me to found Datawalt's first Data Engineering Cell. As Cell Chief, my responsibility is to:

- **Lead a team** focused on improving existing integrations
- **Create new solutions** for data extraction and processing
- **Maintain the vision** of being the best data extractor in LATAM
- **Coordinate** with different areas of the company

## Technologies and Tools

Our technology stack includes:

- **Python** for automation and proprietary software development
- **Power BI** for visualization and reports
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **REST APIs** for integration with external systems
- **BI tools** for analysis and metrics

## Lessons Learned

Leading a data team requires balance between:

1. **Technical vision** and **team management**
2. **Innovation** and **production stability**
3. **Automation** and **flexibility** for special cases
4. **Scalability** and **code maintainability**

## The Future

Our goal remains to create the best data extractor in LATAM. This means continuing to innovate, improving our integrations, and maintaining the technical excellence that has brought us here.

The key to success has been combining my passion for automation with leadership skills, creating a team that not only solves technical problems but anticipates business needs.
